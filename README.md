Common C library functions


Common repository for code I've been replicating in various projects over a long
time.

**Note**:

The ABI is currently being correctly stabilised for an initial full release.

The Name
--------

I was completely out of ideas for a library name. Evidence being that this
was previously `libthingamabob`. Therefore I took the NATO phonetic spelling
of my name, Ikey:

	india kilo echo yankee

And then took the 2nd letter from each word, to form 'nica'. It is pronounced
the same way as the female name, Nica (a variation of Nika).
